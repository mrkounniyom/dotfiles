# DotFiles

Typical public dotfiles repo used for GNU/LINUX systems. 

## Contents 
| File/Directory        | Description |
| -----------           | ----------- |
| .doom.d | [Doom EMACS](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) config files. |
| alacritty | [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) config. Requires [nerdfonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) if used as is. | 
| dunst | [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) config. Lightweight notification daemon. |
| i3 | [i3gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) config files. I prefer i3-gaps because I like vanity gaps. | 
| neofetch | [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) cute system information tool. | 
| polybar | [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) config. Slightly more configurable bar than the i3status. | 
| qtile | [qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile) config files. I have them broken down into separate python scripts. | 
| ranger | [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) config file. Neat vim-like file manager. |
| rofi | [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) config files. Window switcher/Application Launcher. |
| .bashali | Bash alias file some are commented out as needed. | 
| .bashrc | Self explanatory. | 
| .vimrc | Vim RC. Makes uses of Vundle for plugins. Mostly used for basic terminal editing/viewing. | 
| betterlockscreenrc | [betterlockscreen](https://github.com/betterlockscreen/betterlockscreen) config file which I think is a fast/better lockscreen for GNU/LINUX. | 
| starship.toml | [starship prompt](https://starship.rs/) a cleaner & highly configurable prompt for various terminals/shells. | 

## Todo
+ Update QTILE Configs.
